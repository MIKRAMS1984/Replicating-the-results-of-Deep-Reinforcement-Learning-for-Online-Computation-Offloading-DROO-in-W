Replicating the results of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Computation Offloading (DROO) in Wireless Powered MEC Networks.

I am using Google Colab to replicate and understand the results of DROO algorithm, a research article published in  IEEE transaction on Mobile Computing in November, 2020. DROO algo. was tested on 12 GB RAM as claimed by the authors.
